# How to add track types

**Audience**: Adminstrators

## Using track types when uploading tracks

1. Click **Upload**
1. The default track type is 'Music'
1. Click the drop down menu to select another type

Now when uploading tracks, they will be set with the track type that is selected. This helps organize your track files by the type of audio uploaded. Example, if you have a group of files for commercials that needs to be uploaded, choose "Commercial". Now when uploading that group of files, all your tracks will be set with the "Commercial" type. Commercial is included by default with LT, but you can create your own type in settings.

## Create track types

1. Click **Settings**
1. Click **Track Types**
1. Click **New Track Type**
1. On the "Code" field, type a unique code that can be easily identifiable. Example, for Music use "MUS". If no code is typed, it will use the Track Type ID number instead. If admin prefers using ID numbers, leave this field as it is or blank to automatically add it.  
1. On the "Type Name" field, type a the name of the type of tracks. Example, "Station IDs".
1. On the "Description" field, enter the description of the type given.
1. On the "Visibility" drop down menu, choose to enable or disable the track type. By default, it is enabled. If disabled, it won't be shown across Libretime, including in the API for developers.
1. Click **Save**.
