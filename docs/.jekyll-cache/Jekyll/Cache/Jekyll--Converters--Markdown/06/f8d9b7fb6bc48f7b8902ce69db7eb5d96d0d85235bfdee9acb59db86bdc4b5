title: Contributing to LibreTime
blurb: LibreTime is a community project, maintained by an awesome group of volunteers. Being a ‚Äúfree as in freedom‚Äù project, we need the help of our users to keep the project going. You don‚Äôt have to know how to write code in order to help. Check out some of ways you can give back to the LibreTime project below.</p>

Create a bug report by selecting <strong>Get Started</strong> next to <strong>Bug Report</strong>. That way, the LibreTime team can keep track of
your problem and notify you when it has been fixed. You can also suggest

<p>Are you familar with coding in PHP? Have you made projects in Liquidsoap and some of the other services we use?
Take a look at the bugs and feature requests <a href="https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/issues">here</a>, and then
fork our repo and have a go! Just use the <strong>Fork</strong> button at the top of our <strong>Code</strong> page, clone the forked repo to
your desktop, open up a favorite editor and make some changes, and then commit, push, and open a pull request.
Knowledge on how to use <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Github</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">Git</a>
will suit you well, use the links for a quick 101.</p>

<h3 id="testing-libretime-in-vagrant">Testing LibreTime in Vagrant</h3>

<p>Before submitting code to the project, it‚Äôs a good idea to test it first. To do this, it‚Äôs easiest to install
LibreTime in a virtural machine on your local system or in a cloud VM. Instructions on how to set up a virtural
instance of LibreTime with Vagrant are located <a href="vagrant">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to try LibreTime in a Docker image,
Odclive has instructions <a href="https://github.com/kessibi/libretime-docker">here</a> for setting up a test image
and a more persistant install.</p>

<h3 id="modifying-the-database">Modifying the Database</h3>
<p>LibreTime is designed to work with a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database server running locally.
LibreTime uses <a href="http://propelorm.org">PropelORM</a> to interact with the ZendPHP components and create the database.</p>

<p>If you are a developer seeking to add new columns to the database here are the steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify <code class="highlighter-rouge">airtime_mvc/build/schema.xml</code> with any changes.</li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">dev_tools/propel_generate.sh</code></li>
  <li>Update the upgrade.sql under <code class="highlighter-rouge">airtime_mvc/application/controllers/upgrade_sql/VERSION</code> for example
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALTER TABLE imported_podcast ADD COLUMN album_override boolean default 'f' NOT NULL;</code></li>
</ol>
