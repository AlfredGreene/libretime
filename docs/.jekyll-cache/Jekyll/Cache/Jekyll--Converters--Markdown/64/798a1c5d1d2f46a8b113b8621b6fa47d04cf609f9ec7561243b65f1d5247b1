<p>In the Master Panel, beneath the <strong>ON AIR</strong> indicator, you will find the <strong>LISTEN</strong> button. This button opens a
pop-up <strong>Live stream</strong> window, which enables you to monitor the streams that have been configured previously
in the <strong>Streams</strong> page on the <strong>System</strong> menu. In the <strong>Live stream</strong> window, a drop-down menu enables you to
switch between the streams which are currently available. Both the streaming server and name of the stream are
shown. Your station logo is shown in the top left corner of the window, if you have uploaded one via
the <strong>Preferences</strong> page on the <strong>System</strong> menu.</p>

  <p>Note: the volume controls in the Listen window only affect what you hear on your computer, not LibreTime’s main output</p>

<p>To display the URL of the stream you are monitoring, so that you can copy and paste it into an email or web page, click the <strong>Share</strong> button. Click the <strong>X</strong> icon to the right of the URL to return to the drop-down menu of available streams.</p>

<p>LibreTime includes a mini-site, which can be accessed at <em>serverIP</em> (for local installations), or
<em>libretime.yourdomain.com</em> or <em>cloudvmIP</em> (for installations to a server on a domain). The site includes your
logo and station description (set under Settings &gt; General), the login button to the LibreTime interface, the schedule for the next seven days,
podcast tabs, and a live feed of your station with the currently playing artist and track displayed.</p>
