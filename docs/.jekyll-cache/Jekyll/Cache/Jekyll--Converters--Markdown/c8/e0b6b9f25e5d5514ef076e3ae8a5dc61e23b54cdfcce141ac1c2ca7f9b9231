  <p>Note: if your Airtime server is accessible from the public Internet (ex. being hosted in a cloud VM)
it is recommended that you create a second administrator account with a secure password and then
delete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin</code> account, for best security practice.</p>

<h2 id="editing-or-deleting-user-accounts">Editing or deleting user accounts</h2>

<p>New user accounts that you add will be shown in the table on the left side of the <strong>Users</strong> page. If you have a
large number of users on the system, you can use the search tool above the table (which has a magnifying glass icon)
to identify specific user accounts. Click the white chevrons in the table headings to sort the search results
by <strong>Username</strong>, <strong>First Name</strong>, <strong>Last Name</strong> or <strong>User Type</strong>.</p>

<p>To edit a user account, click on that userâ€™s row in the table, change the userâ€™s details in the box on the
right side, and then click the <strong>Save</strong> button. To remove a user account, click the small <strong>x</strong> icon to the right
side of its row in the table. You cannot delete your own user account, and usernames cannot be changed once created.</p>
