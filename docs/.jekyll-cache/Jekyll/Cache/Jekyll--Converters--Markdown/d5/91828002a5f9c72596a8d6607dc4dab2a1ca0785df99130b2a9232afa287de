<h1 id="the-podcasts-page">The Podcasts page</h1>

<p>The Podcasts page allows you add subscriptions to podcasts which are often used to syndicated audio files using a URL called a RSS feed. This allows your LibreTime instance to automatically download new shows from the web.</p>

<p>In order to add a podcast you need to get the RSS feed. All podcasts available on iTunes have a RSS feed but it is sometimes hidden. See this issue on our github page <a href="https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/issues/510">#510</a> for more information. RSS feeds that do not end in <em>.xml</em> may be accepted by LibreTime but might fail to download episodes; in that case, download the episode using a podcast client such as <a href="https://gpodder.github.io/">gpodder</a> and then manually upload and schedule the episode. Podcast feeds coming from Anchor.fm have been known to have this issue.</p>

<p>The podcast interfaces provides you with the ability to generate <a href="smartblocks">Smartblocks</a> that can be used in conjunction with <a href="../calendar/#autoloading-playlist">Autoloading Playlists</a> to schedule the newest episode of a podcast without human intervention.</p>

<p>The podcasts dashboard is similar to the tracks view, allowing you to add, edit, and remove
podcasts by the toolbar, in addition to sorting by columns.</p>

<p>To add a podcast, click on the <strong>+ Add</strong> button on the toolbar and provide the podcastâ€™s RSS feed, which usually ends in <em>.xml</em>.
Once the podcastâ€™s feed is recognized, the editor pane opens for the podcast.</p>

<h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>

<p>In the podcasts editor, you can rename the podcast, update settings for the podcast, and manage episodes.
A search box is available to search for episodes within the feed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To import an episode directly into LibreTime, double-click on an episode or select it and click <strong>+ Import</strong>. The podcast will appear under tracks with the Podcast Name as the Album.</li>
