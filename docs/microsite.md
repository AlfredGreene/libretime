## Radio page

![](img/radio-page.png)

LibreTime includes a mini-site, which can be accessed at _serverIP_ (for local installations), or
_libretime.yourdomain.com_ or _cloudvmIP_ (for installations to a server on a domain). The site includes your
logo and station description (set under Settings > General), the login button to the LibreTime interface, the schedule for the next seven days,
podcast tabs, and a live feed of your station with the currently playing artist and track displayed.

The background of the radio page can be changed; see instructions [here](interface-customization).
